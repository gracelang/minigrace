Minigrace: A Compiler for the Grace language
============================================

Minigrace compiles Grace to JavaScript. The compiler is written in
Grace itself. It supports most of the specified language.  The current
language specification is on github at gracelang/language, or at
http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~grace/doc/.

In the past, mingrace had backends that generated C, Java and LLVM, as well as
an XML encoding of the parse tree.  These are no longer supported.  The last C
version is on branch lastCVersion, which was abandoned on 31 March 2017.

Details on how the language supported by _minigrace_ differs from the spec are in
<doc/errata>.

Minigrace should work on POSIX-compliant systems, and is known to work
on Linux, NetBSD, and MacOS. It requires a working installation of node.js and npm.
If you don't hav ethese already, the best way to get them is to first install
`npm`, the node package manager, from https://github.com/npm-sh/npm

A "stable" verison of minigrace can be installed with `npm install minigrace`.
The bootstrapping process works by installing this stable compiler locally, and
then using it to compile the curent development compiler. This compiler is then
used to compile itself.

After boostrapping, the compiled javascript files will be in the j2/ directory.
The script j2/minigrace-js will run the compiler; try j2/minigrace-js --help.

    j2/minigrace-js --version

will report the version number and the sha of the git repository from which the
compiler was built.  The simplest usage is just:

    j2/minigrace-js file.grace

which will compile file.grace to Javascript and then run it.   Usually, running
a Grace program will require some library modules, such as the _standard_ module,
or the definition of the dialect that you are using. _Minigrace_ searches for
libraries in the directory of the source file, in the current directory, and in
directories along the environment variable GRACE_MODULE_PATH (which should be a
list of directories separated by colons).

Minigrace's documentation files are listed in the <doc/index> file.
