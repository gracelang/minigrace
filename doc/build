Minigrace should compile on any POSIX-compatible system with GCC. The
build instructions differ according to how the source code was
distributed.

Tarball
-------
A tarball distribution should build simply with `make` (or `gmake`, or
the name of GNU make on your system). You may run `./configure` manually
to specify options for your system.

You can re-build Minigrace from the Grace source, rather than the
pregenerated C files in the tarball, by running `make selfhost`.

Tarballs are available from <http://ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~mwh/minigrace/dist/>

Git
---
The Git repository is capable of bootstrapping itself with `make` on
some systems, but it is recommended to bootstrap from a recent tarball
and is required on some platforms.

To bootstrap from a tarball, run `tools/tarball-bootstrap` and it will
provide instructions for downloading the correct tarball. You can then
run the script again, passing in the path to the downloaded tarball,
after which `make` will compile the latest version. If you run
`tools/tarball-bootstrap -a` it will attempt to download the correct
file itself and then build from it.

After the first build you should be able to `git pull` and `make`
without bootstrapping again. You will sometimes need to `make clean`
when an ABI-incompatible change has been made.

The main Git repository can be cloned with:
  git clone git://github.com/mwh/minigrace.git
or:
  git clone https://github.com/mwh/minigrace.git
  
The build process
-----------------

There is a folk-theorem that if a self-hosting system can compile itself
three times, then it is correct.  This theorem is of course false, but
compiling three times does give one some confidence that _the features 
of minigrace exercised by he minigrace compiler_ are being compiled
correctly.  (It does nothing at all for the features of minigrace not
exercised by the compiler, such as minigraces's behaviour when given 
non-programs, or dialects).

The subdirectory known-good comptains old but working binary versions
of the minigrace compiler, orgainized by architecture in a directory
named by the git commit hash for that version.  The version identified by
the STABLE variable in the makefile is used to compile the compiler.
The output of this compilation is stired in the l1 subdirectory.

If this is successful, then the l1/minigrace compiler is used to compile
the compiler again; the resulting files are in the the l2 directory.
So the l2 directory will contain the binaries emitted by a run of your new
version of the compiler.

Finally, the l2/minigrace compiler is used to compile the compiler once
again.  If the compiler is emmitting bad code, then this is unlikely to
work — which is a good thing!   If the l2 compilation succeeds, then you
should try running the tests (make test and make test.js) which will exercise
some of the features of minigrace (such as its treatment of
non-programs, and programs with types) not used in minigrace itself.

Post-build
----------
The `make test` target will run the test suite. All tests are expected
to pass; if any do not, please send the tests/test.log file to the
author.

From a Git checkout only, `make js` will build the JavaScript frontend
used on <http://ecs.vuw.ac.nz/~mwh/minigrace/js/>. The frontend is
accessible in js/index.html. Note that in general the file must be
served over HTTP for the test cases to load. The JavaScript back- and
front-ends are suitable for quick testing, but have some limitations
compared to the native compiler.

Installation
------------
The `make install` target will install Minigrace and its libraries into
the location you specified with the --prefix option to the configure
script, or /usr if no prefix was given. If $PREFIX/bin is on your path
after this you will be able to run `minigrace` from anywhere. This works
for both tarball and Git builds.

Platform notes
--------------
On both Mac OS X and Cygwin building from the git repository requires
bootstrapping from a tarball the first time.

On Mac OS X, Xcode is required to compile. The environment must be set
up to ensure that gcc and ld are in the path and that GCC is able to
compile C code. Setting the following environment variables is known to
be required in many cases:
  PATH
  C_INCLUDE_PATH
  LIBRARY_PATH
The script c/environ-Darwin attempts to detect and set up these
variables correctly on systems that do not have the command-line
development tools set up.

Under Cygwin, all builds will be static because of limitations in
dynamic libraries in the PE format.
