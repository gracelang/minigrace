Minigrace supports exceptions and exception handlers. Exceptions are
raised by requesting the "raise" method on an exception object,
providing a string message to accompany the exception. Exception
handlers are defined using the try-catch construct, which is similar to
match-case, except that the first argument must be a block.

    try {
        // Some code that may raise an exception
    } catch { e : SomeError ->
        ...
    } catch { e : AnotherError ->
        ...
    } finally {
        ...
    }

Inside the catch blocks, e is the exception packet created from
the raised exception. This object has a "message" field containing the
message provided when the exception was raised, and an "exception" field
pointing to the exception kind it was raised from.

The first catch-block with a matching exception will be executed. Exceptions
that are not handled by any catch-block propagate up the stack to the
next-defined exception handler, or to the top where they will be
reported as errors and terminate the program.

The finally block will always execute before control leaves the
try(_)catch(_)... construct, whether or not an exception is raised, and
whether or not one of the catch blocks returns.  Finally clauses can return
early, either by executing a `return`, or by raising an exception. In such
a situation, any prior `return` or raised exception is silently dropped.

## Kinds of Exception

Grace defines a hierarchy of kinds of exception.
All exceptions have the same type, that is, they understand the same set of requests.
However, there are various kinds of exception, corresponding to various kinds of
exceptional situation.

The exception hierarchy classifies these kinds of exception using `ExceptionKind`
objects, which have the following type:

    type ExceptionKind = Pattern & {
    parent -> ExceptionKind
    // answers the exceptionKind that is the parent of this exception in the
    // hierarchy. The parent of exception is defined to be exception. The parent
    // of any other exceptionKind is the exception that was refined to create it.

    refine (name:String) -> ExceptionKind
    // answers a new exceptionKind, which is a refinement of self.

    raise (message:String)
    // creates an exception of this kind, terminating the current execution,
    // and transferring control to an appropriate handler.

    raise (message:String) with (data:Object)
    // similar to raise(), except that the object data is associated with the
    // new exception.
    }

Because `ExceptionKinds` are also `Patterns`, they support the pattern protocol
(`match`, `&`, and `|`).
Perhaps more pertinently, this means that they can be used as the argument of
the `catch blocks` in a `try()catch()...` construct.

At the top of the hierarchy is the `Exception` object; all exceptions are
refinements of `exception`.  There are three immediate refinements, of `Exception`.

 * `EnvironmentException`: those exceptions arising from interactions between the program and the environment, including network exceptions, file system exceptions, and inappropriate user input.
 * `ProgrammingError`: exceptions arising from programming errors.
Examples are `IndexOutOfBounds`, `NoSuchMethod`, and `NoSuchObject`.
 * `ResourceException`: exceptions arising from an implementation insufficiency, such as running out of memory or disk space.

Notice that there is no category for "expected" exceptions.
This is deliberate; expected events should not be represented by exceptions,
but by other values and control structures.
For example, if you you have a key that may or may not be in a dictionary,
you should not request the `at` method and catch the `NoSuchObject` error.
Instead, you should request the `at()ifAbsent()` method.

Each exception is matched by the `ExceptionKind` that was raised to create it,
and all of the ancestors of that kind of exception. Because `Exception`
is the top of the exception hierarchy, it matches all exceptions.

Exceptions have the following type.


    type Exception = type {
        exception -> exceptionKind	// the exceptionKind of this exception.
        message -> String
        // the message that was provided when this exaction was raised.

        data -> Object 		// the data object that was associated with this exception
        // when it was raised, if there was one. Otherwise, the string "no data".

        lineNumber -> Number		// the source code line number
        // of the raise request that created this exception.

        moduleName -> String		// the name of the module
        // containing the raise request that created this exception.

        backtrace -> List<String>
        // a description of the call stack at the time that this exception was raised.
        // backtrace.first is the initial execution environment; backtrace.last is the
        // context that raised the exception.
    }

Exceptions are
distinguished by the name passed to the refine method when they were
created.

Exception packets also contain a "data" field, which may be populated
with any object using the raise(_)with(_) method on exceptions:

  MyError.raise "A message" with (anObject)

There is no behaviour or requirement attached to this object. It is
simply stored to be used by the exception handler if desired.

A single handler may be defined for more than one kind of exception
using the | pattern combinator:

    try {
        ...
    } case { e : MyError | AnotherError ->
        ...
    }

This handler will be run when either MyError or AnotherError is raised
inside the try block.
