In order to type-check against types declared in imported modules, the GCT
file for a compiled module contains information about the types in that module.
The idea is to have just enough information in the GCT to allow for the types
to be parsed and rebuilt completely as ObjectTypes by the static-types dialect.

The GCT contains this type information with a list of all types declared in the
module, and for each type a list of the type's methodtype signatures. The list
of types in collectionsPrelude.gct looks like this:

    types:
     Binding
     Collection
     CollectionFactory
     ComparableToDictionary
     Dictionary
     Enumerable
     EqualityObject
     Expandable
     Function0
     Function1
     Function2
     Iterable
     Iterator
     List
     MinimalyIterable
     Predicate1
     Procedure0
     Procedure1
     Procedure2
     SelfType
     Sequence
     Set

Note that any generic parameters are left off in this type list. The list of
methodtypes for Binding looks like this:

    methodtypes-of:Binding⟦K, T⟧:
     9 ==(other:Unknown) → Boolean
     9 hash → Number
     9 key → K
     9 value → T

Note that the type parameters are included here. The only part of the list
of methodtypes that is not self-explanatory is the prefix on each line, which 
is always either  &,  |, or a number. If the prefix of a line is a number, it
means that that methodtype is listed within a type literal, and all other lines
which are prefixed with the same number come from the same type literal. This
is useful in cases like the following, where a type is composed of two type
literals:

    methodtypes-of:Z:
     & 3
     & 4
     3 m4(x : Y) -> Y
     4 m5(x : Z) -> Z

This means that type Z is the & type of two type literals, represented by 3
and 4. One type literal has just the method m4, and the other has just the
method m5. The actual values of these numbers are not significant; it only 
matters that lines with different number prefixes are from different type
literals.

Finally, note how and types and variant types are prefixed with & or |. An
entry to the GCT that looks like this:

    methodtypes-of:D:
     & Collection⟦T⟧
     & F
     & G

...means that type D is the & type of three types: Collection⟦T⟧ & F & G. An entry
to the GCT that looks like this:

    methodtypes-of:A:
     2 m1(n : Number) -> Number
     2 m2(n : Number) -> Done
     | 2
     | B⟦T⟧
     | other.C

...means that type A is a variant type of B⟦T⟧ | other.C | 2, where 2 is a type
literal that contains two methods (m1 and m2).
