# The Old JS Translation

The JS backend translates Grace objects into JS objects.
As of mid 2015, this translation has a number of deficiencies:

 - Grace methods are stored as properties of a methods object
 - Grace superobjects are stored in the superobject property of the JS object.
 - Grace fields are stored in a data object, except for
 - Built-in objects like strings and Numbers, where the data is stored in 
   a _value property.
   
As a consequence, Grace method dispatch must be coded up as a search through the
methods object, followed by a search through the methods object of the superobject,
and so on.

Another consequence is that great care must be taken not to add to of change
the methods object of an object that actually gets its methods object from a
prototype. If this is done accidentally, the prototype will be corrupted, 
and all other objects that use this prototype will see the change.  

APB, August 2015: I think that a better scheme would be to make the Grace methods
methods of the JS object, having mangled their name by adding a suitable prefix,
like GR_ or ⓖ, or 𝒢.   Similarly, fields of the Grace object should be fields of
the Javascript object.

A more serious deficiency is that `outer` is represented as a method, and thus
is dynamically bound.  This is wrong; `outer` must be statically bound, and an
object that is composed using inheritance has a separate outer for each of the
parent objects.

To support the non-differentiation of methods and fields, Grace zero-argument
functions should always be compiled into JS get functions.

# New Inheritance Strategy, September 2016

## Outer

`outer` is now compiled as an attribute of the object with a name that depends
on the module and the line on which the object is declared.  These outer
attributes are installed in inheriting objects, so that each object may have
several `outer` attributes, each with a slightly different name.  Methods access
these outer attributes directly, so each method can have its own outer, and
no Grace method dispatch is required.

Outer chains that reference the module object are compiled specially.  Since the
module object is always a singleton, these outer references are compiled into
references to the appropriate module object.

## Object COnstruction

Object construction is implemented using methods with the $build(3) suffix.
The three arguments to the $build part are the inheriting object, into which the
$build(3) method installs its stuff, a JS Array of aliases, and a JS Array
of exclusions.  The $build(3) method makes the appropriate changes to
inheriting object.  It implements inheritance by first calling the $build method
of any object that it is inheriting from.

## Object Initialization

Every $build method returns a JS init function that is specialized to initialize
the object just built.  The build method gets the arguments of the fresh object;
these are captured in the generated init method.  This is unfortunately rather
slow, since JS closures seem not to be optimized.

A fresh method x(1) is compiled into a method x(1)$build(3), as well as a method x(1).
In non-inheritance contexts, the code will request x(1), which is implemented by

    * constructing a new graceObject (call it ouc, for object under construction)
    * passing ouc to $build, which modified ouc, and then
    * initializing ouc using the init function.

In inheritance contexts, the code will request x(1)$build(3) with appropriate extra
arguments.

To support this, object constructors are also compiled in two ways.
They generate a _build function, which is similar to the $build method of a
fresh method, and which returns an _init function.   They also generate
an ordinary JS function, which is used in non-inheritance contexts, and which is
implemented by passing a new graceObject to the _build function.
The register of the objectNode refers to this ordinary function; the _build function
can be named by adding the suffix _build.

Thus, the compiled form of a Grace object is a flat JavaScript object.  The
inheritance chain is compiled away, and need not be searched at runtime.

## Inheriting from "special" methods

prelude.clone is treated as a fresh method, as are true and false.   They have
hand-built $build(3) variants in the standard library, which are called by the
compiled code just like the generted $buidl(3) variants for other fresh methods.
Thus, from the persepctive of code-generation, they don't really need to be
"special".  However, the .gct mechanism does not yet classify them as fresh, so
these are still special cases in identifierresolution.
