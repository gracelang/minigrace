// This fails because the underlying support for unicode in Javascript is 
// broken.  In particular,  .asUpper method in string turns "ÃŸ" into "SS" 
// rather than capital "áºž", which has been part of the Unicode standard
// since 2008.
//
// A more serious problem is illustrated by pileOfPoo, which is not in the 
// Basic MultiCode Plane.  It's represeneted as ðŸ’©
// PILE OF POO
// Unicode: U+1F4A9 (U+D83D U+DCA9), UTF-8: F0 9F 92 A9
// i.e. 2 UTF-16 entities, which is what ECMASCRIPT's length property counts.
