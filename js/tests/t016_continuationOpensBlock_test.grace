// The formatting of this code is legal.  Line 6 is not a continuation line,

// left brace means that no separator is implied at the end of line 5.
// Line 7, the body of the while block, has the same indentation as the condition.
//
// Special code for block bodies in the parser was complaining
// that the body was not indented, because it was taking the indentation of
// the `{` to be that of line 6, not line 5.  This code has been removed.
